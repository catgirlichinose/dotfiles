# My Hatsune Miku themed hyprland dotfiles (a lot of stuff might change)

Includes:
- Catppuccin themed GTK and Firefox theme (GTK theme made with gradience)
- Hyprland and Hyprpaper configuration made by me
- Vesktop client with catppuccin theme
- Kitty + Fastfetch + zsh configuration (based on [zenshrc](https://github.com/dreamsofautonomy/zensh/blob/))
- Barely complete Waybar configuration (yeah that's probably gonna be worked on)

## Installation

**Note: These dotfiles are meant to be installed on a fresh Arch Linux, stuff COULD and most likely WILL break**

Clone the repo in the home directory

    git clone https://github.com/catgirlichinose/dotfiles.git

and run the installer

    ./install.sh 
    
## TODO

- [x] fix the poorly made install script
- [ ] actually configure waybar properly
- [ ] find a way to automatically setup firefox extensions  
- [ ] probably format everything a bit better
- [ ] make a miku themed sddm theme
- [ ] maybe add more wallpapers????
- [ ] banana

## Credits

# My Hatsune Miku themed hyprland dotfiles (a lot of stuff might change)

Includes:
- Catppuccin themed GTK and Firefox theme (GTK theme made with gradience, Firefox is a semi-modified version of [Firefox GX](https://github.com/Godiesc/firefox-gx).
- Hyprland and Hyprpaper configuration made by me
- Rofi configuration
- Vesktop client with catppuccin theme
- Kitty + Fastfetch + zsh configuration (based on [zenshrc](https://github.com/dreamsofautonomy/zensh/blob/))
- Barely complete Waybar configuration (yeah that's probably gonna be worked on)
- Customized NvChad config

## Installation

**Note: These dotfiles are meant to be installed on a fresh Arch Linux, stuff COULD and most likely WILL break**

Clone the repo in the home directory

    git clone https://github.com/catgirlichinose/dotfiles.git

    ./install.sh

- [ ] probably format everything a bit better
- [ ] make a miku themed sddm theme
- [ ] maybe add more wallpapers????

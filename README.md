Includes:
- Catppuccin themed GTK and Firefox theme (GTK theme made with gradience, Firefox is a semi-modified version of [Firefox GX](https://github.com/Godiesc/firefox-gx).
- Hyprland and Hyprpaper configuration made by me
- Vesktop client with catppuccin theme
- Kitty + Fastfetch + zsh configuration (based on [zenshrc](https://github.com/dreamsofautonomy/zensh/blob/main/.zshrc)
